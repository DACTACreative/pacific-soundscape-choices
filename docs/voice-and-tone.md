- "Remote" or "isolated" (Pacific is connected)
- "Primitive" or "backward" practices

## Content Categories

### Question Text
**Style**: Direct, scenario-based, presenting genuine dilemmas
**Tone**: Respectful of complexity, acknowledging trade-offs
**Length**: 1-2 sentences maximum, clear choice presentation

**Good Example:**
> "Sea levels are rising faster than expected, endangering whole villages. How do you respond?"

**Poor Example:**
> "There might be some potential future risks from possible sea-level changes that could impact certain communities. What would you possibly consider doing?"

### Answer Options
**Style**: Specific, actionable choices reflecting real policy decisions
**Tone**: Balanced—no "obviously right" answers
**Length**: Concise headlines that convey clear direction

**Good Example:**
> "Establish community-led early warning systems and traditional knowledge networks"

**Poor Example:**
> "Try to help communities with some kind of warning system"

### Scenario Descriptions (2050 Outcomes)
**Style**: Vivid, specific imagery grounded in data
**Tone**: Honest about consequences, specific about impacts
**Length**: 3-4 sentences painting a clear picture

**Good Example:**
> "By 2050, Suva's seawall is overtopped at high tides; the downtown market floods regularly. Coral reefs are largely dead, leading to the collapse of coastal fisheries. Some outer island communities have been abandoned, their residents living as climate migrants on Viti Levu."

**Poor Example:**
> "In the future, there might be some challenges with water and possibly some issues with fishing and maybe some people will need to move."

### Impact Narratives
**Style**: Connect choices to consequences clearly
**Tone**: Educational, cause-and-effect clarity
**Length**: 1-2 sentences linking decision to outcome

**Good Example:**
> "Your investment in renewable energy helps Fiji achieve its 100% clean electricity goal, reducing regional emissions and demonstrating Pacific climate leadership."

**Poor Example:**
> "The renewable energy thing could possibly be good for the environment."

### Data Presentations
**Style**: Clear numbers with context and meaning
**Tone**: Authoritative but accessible
**Format**: Source attribution, human-scale references

**Good Example:**
> "Sea level: +25 cm by 2050 (leading to 10x more flood days annually) - NASA Sea Level Projections"

**Poor Example:**
> "Waters might be higher causing some flooding issues"

## Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines

### Pacific Sovereignty
- Pacific nations make their own decisions
- Avoid framing as "victims" needing external rescue
- Emphasize Pacific leadership in climate action
- Respect for Pacific institutions and governance

### Traditional Knowledge
- Traditional practices are sophisticated, not primitive
- Integrate traditional and scientific knowledge respectfully
- Acknowledge Pacific innovations and solutions
- Avoid romanticizing or oversimplifying traditions

### Climate Justice
- Acknowledge the inequity: low emissions, high impact
- Frame as global responsibility, not Pacific burden
- Emphasize collective action while respecting sovereignty
- Connect local impacts to global causes

## Example Voice Applications

### Introduction Text
**Good Voice:**
> "Pacific Islands steward nearly 20% of Earth's surface—vast ocean territories that sustain global climate stability. Yet these communities face disproportionate risks from climate change they did little to cause. Your choices as a Pacific leader will shape what the Blue Pacific looks like in 2050."

**Poor Voice:**
> "The Pacific Islands are small developing nations that are vulnerable to climate change and need help adapting to future impacts."

### Question Setup
**Good Voice:**
> "Pacific youth are drifting from traditional practices, and the environment is suffering. Pollinators are declining, and ancestral knowledge is at risk. How will you revive cultural connections and heal nature?"

**Poor Voice:**
> "Young people don't follow old ways anymore and there are environmental problems. What should be done?"

### Outcome Description
**Good Voice:**
> "By 2050, the Pacific has become a global beacon of sustainable development. Traditional knowledge seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge technology. Coral reefs show signs of recovery, blue economies flourish, and Pacific voices lead international climate action."

**Poor Voice:**
> "In 2050, the Pacific region has some good environmental practices and the economy is doing okay with international support."
