# Next Developer Actionables - Choose Your Pacific Future

## Current Status Overview

The Pacific Game is functionally complete with a solid foundation but has several critical issues that need addressing before full launch. The game logic works correctly, routing between scenarios functions, and audio integration is implemented. However, production deployment reveals several user experience issues that require immediate attention.

## üö® Critical Priority Issues (Must Fix First)

### 1. Answer Display Crisis
**Status**: ‚ùå BROKEN IN PRODUCTION
**Problem**: GameScreen shows answer codes ("A1", "B1") instead of full answer text
**Impact**: Game is essentially unplayable for users
**Root Cause**: CSV parsing fails or returns incomplete data in production environment
**Files**: `src/components/GameScreen.tsx` (lines 150-200)

**Action Required**:
- Implement robust CSV loading with multiple fallback strategies
- Add comprehensive error handling for fetch failures
- Include retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add loading states and error messages for users
- Test thoroughly with network throttling and offline scenarios

**Technical Notes**:
```tsx
// Current problematic code in GameScreen.tsx
const answerData = Papa.parse(csvText, { header: true }).data;
// Needs error handling, validation, and fallbacks
```

### 2. Spider Chart Hover/Touch Malfunction
**Status**: ‚ùå BROKEN IN PRODUCTION
**Problem**: Hover events not working on mobile devices, inconsistent behavior
**Impact**: Users cannot see detailed impact information for their choices
**Root Cause**: Chart.js event handling differs between development and production
**Files**: `src/components/ThematicSpiderChart.tsx` (lines 180-220)

**Action Required**:
- Add touch/click event handlers alongside hover
- Implement fallback interaction methods
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser emulation
- Add visual indicators for interactive elements
- Consider alternative interaction patterns (click to expand, etc.)

### 3. Production Environment Differences
**Status**: ‚ùå INCONSISTENT BEHAVIOR
**Problem**: Features work in preview but fail in deployed version
**Impact**: Unpredictable user experience, debugging difficulties
**Root Cause**: Build process differences, CDN loading issues, environment-specific configurations

**Action Required**:
- Create environment-specific configuration files
- Implement better error boundaries throughout the application
- Add comprehensive logging for production debugging
- Test production builds locally before deployment
- Set up proper error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)

## üîß Important Functionality Issues

### 4. Spider Chart Scoring Logic
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è INCORRECT CALCULATIONS
**Problem**: Theme scores can exceed maximum of 3, incorrect level mapping
**Expected**: 0-1=LOW, 2=MEDIUM, 3+=HIGH
**Files**: `src/components/ThematicSpiderChart.tsx` (lines 120-140)

**Action Required**:
- Implement proper score capping at 3 points maximum
- Fix theme counting logic to prevent over-counting
- Add clear level mapping function (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Validate scoring algorithm against expected outcomes
- Add unit tests for scoring calculations

### 5. Excessive Information Overload
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è USER EXPERIENCE ISSUE
**Problem**: Scenario end pages overwhelm users with too much data
**Impact**: Users lose focus on key insights and outcomes
**Files**: `src/pages/Scenario1.tsx`, `src/pages/Scenario2.tsx`, `src/pages/Scenario3.tsx`

**Action Required**:
- Streamline content to focus on 3-5 key impacts maximum
- Create progressive disclosure for additional details
- Improve visual hierarchy and readability
- Add clear next action steps for users
- Consider alternative layouts (tabs, accordion, etc.)

### 6. Blue Pacific Stories Section Issues
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è POOR DATA ORGANIZATION
**Problem**: User choices not properly organized by theme categories
**Files**: `src/components/BluePacificStoriesSection.tsx`

**Action Required**:
- Implement proper data grouping by theme
- Show clear connections between choices and outcomes
- Improve narrative flow and readability
- Add visual indicators for theme categories
- Better integration with spider chart data

## üé® Visual and Performance Issues

### 7. VANTA.js Tree Performance Problems
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PERFORMANCE IMPACT
**Problem**: Tree background effects causing slow loading and poor performance
**Impact**: Particularly bad on mobile devices and slower connections
**Files**: Multiple pages using VANTA backgrounds

**Action Required**:
- Remove VANTA tree effects entirely
- Replace with CSS-based background animations
- Implement simple gradient or static image backgrounds
- Measure and improve loading performance
- Add performance monitoring for future optimization

### 8. Missing Scenario Images
**Status**: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE FEATURE
**Problem**: No visual images on scenario pages as originally planned
**Files**: All scenario pages (`src/pages/Scenario*.tsx`)

**Action Required**:
- Source appropriate images for each scenario (coral reefs, sea level rise, etc.)
- Implement responsive image loading with proper alt text
- Add image optimization for web delivery
- Consider using placeholder images during development
- Ensure images align with scenario narratives

### 9. Font Consistency Issues
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è DESIGN INCONSISTENCY
**Problem**: Spider chart fonts don't match overall site typography
**Files**: `src/components/ThematicSpiderChart.tsx`

**Action Required**:
- Apply Inter font family consistently across all chart elements
- Ensure proper font weight and sizing hierarchy
- Fix chart label rendering issues
- Test font rendering across different browsers
- Update Chart.js configuration for typography consistency

## üìä Data and Structure Improvements

### 10. Debug Panel Preloading Issue
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT ISSUE
**Problem**: Debug panel shows data before user makes any selections
**Files**: `src/components/DebugPanel.tsx`

**Action Required**:
- Only display debug information after user interactions
- Add production-safe debug toggle
- Organize debug information more clearly
- Add session storage validation
- Consider removing debug panel from production builds

### 11. Scenario Page Inconsistency
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è CONTENT STRUCTURE
**Problem**: Three scenario pages have different layouts and content organization
**Files**: `src/pages/Scenario1.tsx`, `src/pages/Scenario2.tsx`, `src/pages/Scenario3.tsx`

**Action Required**:
- Create consistent layout template for all scenarios
- Standardize content sections and hierarchy
- Ensure responsive design works across all pages
- Unify navigation and interaction patterns
- Add proper meta tags and SEO optimization

### 12. Additional Data Visualizations Needed
**Status**: ‚ùå FEATURE INCOMPLETE
**Problem**: Game needs more charts beyond the spider chart
**Suggested**: Flooding days chart, sea level rise projections, fisheries impact

**Action Required**:
- Create `FloodingDaysVisualization.tsx` component
- Implement sea level rise projection chart
- Add fisheries impact visualization
- Integrate CSV data sources already available
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all charts

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

### Current Testing Gaps
- [ ] **Production Environment Testing**: Test actual deployed version thoroughly
