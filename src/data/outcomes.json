  "low": "By 2050, the Pacific has become a global beacon of sustainable development and climate resilience. Strong mitigation efforts worldwide kept global warming below 1.5°C, while your Pacific-led initiatives in renewable energy, ocean conservation, and community empowerment have created thriving, climate-adapted societies. Traditional knowledge seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge technology. Coral reefs show signs of recovery, blue economies flourish, and Pacific voices lead international climate action. The region exemplifies how small island states can drive transformational change for the entire planet.",
  
  "medium": "Global warming reached 2°C by 2050, bringing significant challenges to the Pacific, but strategic regional cooperation and adaptive governance have enabled communities to weather the changes. While some coral reefs face serious stress, innovative restoration programs maintain critical ecosystems. Rising seas required managed retreat from vulnerable areas, but comprehensive planning ensured cultural continuity. Pacific nations have diversified their economies and strengthened regional bonds, demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of moderate climate change.",
  
  "high": "By 2050, global warming has exceeded 2.5°C, presenting severe challenges across the Pacific. Rising seas, intensifying storms, and ecosystem collapse threaten traditional ways of life. Many coastal communities have been displaced, and food security is strained. However, the Pacific's spirit of unity and traditional knowledge of adaptation provide foundations for survival. International support helps with basic needs, but the region faces an uncertain future requiring unprecedented cooperation and innovation to navigate this climate crisis."
