Among the students was Litia, 16, who stayed behind after the session to ask questions about political organising. Inspired by the speakers, she formed a girls' climate club — which later evolved into a civic leadership group. A decade later, Litia won her local council seat and helped write the island's first youth-inclusive environmental charter."

By 2050, it became a recognised mechanism within the Pacific Islands Forum — ensuring that traditional leaders, women, and rural youth had a seat in climate and development negotiations.",
    "narrative": "In North Tarawa, community leader Tekiera joined her first Ina i-Tu circle — one of dozens launched across the islands. Discussions once confined to government halls were now taking place under trees and beside canoes. Her voice — rooted in ancestral knowledge and lived climate experience — soon echoed beyond her village. Within five years, she was appointed to Kiribati's national adaptation taskforce.

Within a decade, five Pacific countries had adopted similar protocols — and Pacific delegates secured official UN language referencing customary and spiritual loss as a legitimate climate justice concern.",
