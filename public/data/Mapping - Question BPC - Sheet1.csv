A1,theme_points_Political_Leadership_and_Regionalism,"Fund a national climate and leadership tour in Vanuatu, focused on rural women and youth. The tour travels island to island, combining civic education, Indigenous knowledge, and pathways into local politics.

",Political Leadership and Regionalism,Q1,"Many remote villages feel left behind by national development. How will you reconnect and empower your communities?
","1.3 Improved enabling environment for increased representation and participation of all Pacific peoples, including women and girls in all their diversity in leadership to ensure, inclusive and equitable sharing of resources and opportunities. ","The proportion of seats held by women in Vanuatu’s national parliament rose from 2% in 2025 to 27% by 2050. Broader participation of women and girls in political leadership was observed across the region, particularly in local governance and youth councils.

","In Luganville, a climate awareness tour stopped at the local school. Among the students was Litia, 16, who stayed behind after the session to ask questions about political organising.

Inspired by the speakers, she formed a girls’ climate club — which later evolved into a civic leadership group. A decade later, Litia won her local council seat and helped write the island’s first youth-inclusive environmental charter.

",Political Leadership and Regionalism,Q2,"There’s a governance gap between formal institutions and local communities, leading to conflicts and mistrust. What initiative do you support to mend this divide?","2.1 An effective, inclusive and efficient regional architecture that is supported by a coherent and accountable governance mechanism that responds to the Leaders’ vison and ambitions.
","The Ina i-Tu model was formalised across six countries as part of the regional governance system. By 2050, it became a recognised mechanism within the Pacific Islands Forum — ensuring that traditional leaders, women, and rural youth had a seat in climate and development negotiations.","In North Tarawa, community leader Tekiera joined her first Ina i-Tu circle — one of dozens launched across the islands. Discussions once confined to government halls were now taking place under trees and beside canoes.

Her voice — rooted in ancestral knowledge and lived climate experience — soon echoed beyond her village. Within five years, she was appointed to Kiribati’s national adaptation taskforce. Her presence shifted the tone of regional meetings: local wisdom was no longer symbolic — it was strategy."
A3,theme_points_Political_Leadership_and_Regionalism,"The Solomon Islands invests 25% of aid into a Sovereign Oversight Commission to regulate foreign investment and launch the SolPower plan. All new investments must allocate at least 30% toward Blue Pacific 2050 priorities.

",Political Leadership and Regionalism,Q3,"A wave of foreign investment is coming into the region. How do you ensure these deals truly benefit the Pacific and align with its priorities?
","2.3 The Pacific Region is recognised as a leading contributor to global discourse to ensure global actors align with regional initiatives that responds to the vulnerabilities and characteristics of the Pacific

","Development assistance surged from $266M in 2022 to over $1B by 2035 — but under Solomon leadership. By 2050, the country had become a respected global voice in climate finance reform, helping define global guidelines on localised investment and regional equity.

","By 2029, faced with growing foreign pressure, Solomon Islands took control. A new oversight body, led by Indigenous and youth leaders, introduced binding rules: 30% of all incoming investment must directly advance Blue Pacific 2050 goals.

At COP36, they chaired the Pacific Energy Bloc — turning national self-determination into a regional movement.

What do you initiate?,"1.1 Strengthened institutional capacity and capability to address national and regional priorities through effective, inclusive, and responsive governance and leadership.","By 2050, 14 Pacific Island Countries ratified the Blue Pacific Climate Pact into national legislation. Regional climate finance doubled, with 43% allocated to community-led adaptation. The Pacific Small Island States bloc became the largest unified voting bloc in global climate negotiations.","On the atoll of Kioa, 22-year-old Vai joined her island council’s youth assembly — formed after the Pact mandated local participation in adaptation planning. She proposed a mangrove monitoring system, rooted in her grandmother’s fishing maps. Her idea traveled: first to the island, then the district, then the regional forum."
B1,theme_points_People_Centered_Development,"Launch a nationwide “Cellule of Knowledge” initiative that bridges formal healthcare with Indigenous practices. Local elders, healers, and youth are trained as co-practitioners, revitalising trust in health services and embedding cultural protocols into care delivery — especially in remote areas.
",People Centered Development,Q1,"Many remote villages feel left behind by national development. How will you reconnect and empower your communities?
",1.1 Strengthened institutional capacity and capability to address national and regional health priorities.,"Papua New Guinea’s International Health Regulations (IHR) compliance rose from 64% in 2025 to 89% by 2040. Trust in the healthcare system improved as medical institutions integrated Indigenous practitioners and local cultural protocols. Fewer expatriate-run clinics meant more inclusive, community-based care — especially in remote areas.","In Hela Province, the first Cellule of Knowledge circle opened in a repurposed school hall. Elder Mama Keipa joined the clinic team, offering guidance grounded in traditional healing. Her presence shifted perceptions — people returned not just for medicine, but for connection. Youth joined as interpreters and apprentices, and old knowledge became part of daily care.

What began as a pilot became a turning point. Trust grew. Clinics filled. The system felt familiar — and participation followed."
B2,theme_points_People_Centered_Development,"Fiji launches a national mobility-for-health strategy: walkable neighbourhoods, bike paths, and free public transport routes to clinics and wellness hubs, prioritising outer-urban and underserved areas.

",People Centered Development,Q5,Your nation grapples with urban health challenges and rural unemployment. What is your development priority?,"1.2 Strengthened coverage, quality, accessibility, affordable and resilience of health and wellbeing services.","Coverage of essential health services in Fiji increased from 58% in 2025 to 89% by 2050. Improvements were driven not only by clinical expansion but by community-driven infrastructure that removed key barriers to access, especially in low-income and peri-urban areas.","In Nausori, Laisa, a retired grandmother, used to miss health checks due to poor transport. After a new bike path linked her neighbourhood to a local wellness hub — and buses became free — she began attending weekly classes for blood pressure and nutrition.

Soon, she brought her grandkids too. Health became part of the daily rhythm."
B3,theme_points_People_Centered_Development,"French Polynesia launches the “From Grandmother: Best Cooking” challenge — a TikTok-driven campaign where youth film traditional plant-based recipes taught by elders. The initiative reintroduces ancestral crops and cooking skills into schools, homes, and the national food identity.

",People Centered Development,Q6,"Pacific youth are drifting from traditional practices, and the environment is suffering (for example, pollinators are declining). How will you revive cultural knowledge and heal nature?
",1.3 Improved healthy lifestyles across all communities including increased participation in sports and physical activity,"Healthy food policies in schools across French Polynesia shifted from under development to full implementation by 2050. Obesity rates declined, and youth participation in agriculture and cultural cooking practices increased, with several Indigenous vegetables reintroduced into local diets and school meals.
","On the remote island of Tana, a student filmed her grandmother preparing ‘uru kea, a nearly forgotten wild breadfruit variety. The video — part of the “From Grandmother: Best Cooking” challenge — quickly gained traction. Soon, markets in Papeete were requesting seeds, schools started planting them, and the recipe was added to national curriculum materials. A quiet revival had begun — one story, one root at a time."
C1,theme_points_Peace_and_Security,Tuvalu launched the “Navigating with Dignity” programme — a legal-advocacy initiative led by climate-affected island nations to embed cultural identity and community consent into global mobility agreements.,Peace and Security,Q7,"Sea levels are rising faster than expected, endangering whole villages. How do you respond?","1.3 Improved global recognition of the Forum’s contribution to global peace and security, and for promoting the region’s collective security interests and experiences in global security discussions.","By 2050, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands became global reference points for anticipatory displacement policy. Their legal and advocacy efforts shaped new UN frameworks, and over 15 countries adopted mobility agreements grounded in dignity and Pacific-led definitions. Misconceptions around “climate refugees” decreased across multilateral platforms.

","""On Funafuti, a local storytelling hub began documenting elders’ lived experiences of relocation, loss, and resilience. These narratives were not just archived but brought to the UN floor by youth diplomats. As global leaders heard names and stories, not statistics, the Pacific voice reshaped how the world understood climate mobility — not as a threat, but as a shared human responsibility.

","1.2 A strengthened, inclusive and
harmonised regional security architecture,
guided by the Forum processes, with
improved ability to address existing, evolving
and/or emerging security issues; and to
guide decision making on regional and global
security issues.","By 2050, tribal councils in Northern Province and the Loyalty Islands led over half of all local security mediations. Police interventions in Kanak-majority communes decreased significantly as customary systems gained legal authority. Trust in justice systems increased, especially for climate-related, land-based, and domestic conflicts.

","In Canala, tensions rose after a land dispute linked to flood relocation. Instead of involving national police, the local Kawane Council invoked customary protocols under new legal authority. Elders, youth delegates, and public advocates resolved the issue without escalation. For the first time, justice felt anchored in place, not imposed from afar.

Do you focus on grassroots resilience or bolster high-tech governance?,"1.0 Ensuring the security and protection of all Pacific peoples (particularly vulnerable peoples and marginalised groups) by reducing the impacts of climate change, transnational crime, cybercrime, corruption, and threats to human, environmental, and resource security.","By 2050, over 70% of villages in Kiribati operated their own community-run safety hubs. These low-tech systems, built with local materials and knowledge, combined cyclone alerts, water quality checks, and basic incident reporting. Crime rates fell, climate response time improved, and public trust in local systems tripled.

","On the island of Abaiang, retired boatmaker Temoata now teaches youth how to maintain tide sensors and monitor salinity using coconut-shell gauges. Next door, a mother reviews cyclone paths on the chalkboard before walking to the garden. What began as a toolkit became shared power — The station became more than a toolkit: it challenged the idea that safety must come from uniforms, degrees, or outsiders. Protection now looked like everyone — and it belonged to everyone."

","""1.6 Improved policies and legislations to promote and attract quality investment

""","Vanuatu’s Investment Reform Act of 2027 led to a 42% increase in climate-positive investments by 2045. 80% of approved ventures met strict biodiversity and cultural protection criteria. Local landholders negotiated revenue-sharing in 67% of agreements. Net FDI inflow rose without displacing traditional tenure systems.

","In South Pentecost, a bamboo processing firm proposed a partnership. The village council reviewed a “custom benefits clause” — a new legal template from the Investment Office. Instead of selling, they co-owned it. Elders retained decision power, and profits helped rebuild the cyclone shelter.

",Resource and Economic Development,Q9,"To boost local livelihoods without harming nature, what path do you choose?

"," 1.3 Increased opportunities for sustainable diversification of Pacific economies

","By 2050, 63% of outer-island communities in Tonga launched micro-ventures in seaweed, coconut fibre, or clay goods. GDP contribution from non-tourism sectors grew from 22% in 2025 to 39%, supported by low-interest cooperative loans. Reliance on single-sector exports dropped, reducing external vulnerability.

","In Nomuka, a group of weavers began selling coconut-fibre insulation mats to eco-builders on Tongatapu. Their children joined after school, blending tradition with income. Inspired, nearby villages revived taro fermentation pits and seed-oil presses. The whole island stopped relying on seasonal tourism — and thrived year-round.

","Fiji’s national community enterprise registry reached 12,400 cooperatives by 2050. 48% were run by women, with legal status and digital accounting support. Informal vendors accessing micro-tax exemptions and training rose by 70%, and national GDP from small enterprises outpaced tourism for the first time.


","In Nausori Highlands, a young mother registered her community soap cooperative with just three other women. A local law student helped file the papers. They soon got their first bulk sale to a resort chain. What started as a stall under a breadfruit tree now paid for uniforms, bikes — and hope.

","1.3 Increased capacity and opportunity of Pacific governments and communities to effectively address economic and non-economic loss and damage brought on by rapid, extreme, and slow onset events","By 2050, the Solomon Islands piloted the first Customary Loss Registry in the Pacific, documenting cultural, ecological, and spiritual losses tied to climate impacts. The registry shaped a new national compensation framework and directly influenced global recognition of non-economic loss. Within a decade, five Pacific countries had adopted similar protocols — and Pacific delegates secured official UN language referencing customary and spiritual loss as a legitimate climate justice concern.

","After rising tides swept away burial grounds in East Kwaio, the community turned to memory as resistance. Elders, youth, and women gathered to record the songs, rituals, and histories lost with the land. When Mere from Lau later addressed COP34, she opened with this story — not as an anecdote, but as testimony. It reframed loss and damage. Days later, “customary loss” entered the draft text. The Pacific voice had changed the global climate narrative."

 ","1.2 Pacific governments and communities have developed and strengthened capacity for adapting, building resilience, and responding to climate change and disaster risks, particularly for the most vulnerable","By 2050, Climate Avenir expanded into a regionally coordinated initiative. Fifteen Pacific countries implemented legislative frameworks supporting technical climate education and disaster-readiness. Over 3,000 Indigenous youth graduated from top ocean-tech, energy, and engineering programs. Many now lead national climate teams or authored disaster risk legislation, turning education into regional resilience policy.

","In Touho, New Caledonia, Anaïs became the first in her clan to study mechanical engineering in Japan. She used to help her father fix boat motors — now she designs cyclone-ready microgrids. Instead of joining mining or administration, she built the region’s first solar-powered dock for coastal evacuation, sparking copycat efforts across the North.

","Cook Islands’ Red List Index improved from 0.79 in 2025 to 0.87 by 2050, with native bee populations recovering in five islands. Over 70% of villages gained ""pollinator-safe"" certification, creating a visible rebound in endemic flora and reduced dependence on imported pollination inputs.

","In Mauke, when a swarm of ngakinga pua (wild stingless bees) colonised the old church roof, elders took it as a sign. Children started caring for hives in coconut husk boxes, trading stories with grandmothers about the scent of flowers once used in mourning garlands. Soon, every home had a nectar plant at the doorstep — not just for the bees, but to revive greetings with a blossom in hand. When the bees thrived, so did the memory of how to belong to land and season.

","By 2050, 92% of farms in Niue shifted to organic or low-input practices. Import volumes of synthetic fertiliser dropped to zero, while soil health indicators (nitrogen retention, organic matter) improved by 38%. The model was adopted by two other Polynesian countries.

","In Alofi’s coastal gardens, elders taught schoolchildren how to read moon calendars for planting, while seaweed was harvested weekly to brew biofertiliser. The scent of the brew was strong — but pride was stronger. Over time, “fertiliser from the reef” became a symbol of food sovereignty, and farmers began trading recipes, not brands.

","By 2050, Tonga reduced coastal plastic litter by 60%. Their community-led behaviour change campaign — inspired by Pacific neighbours — replaced enforcement with shared learning. The Pacific Peer Platform now connects 12 countries exchanging local cultural alternatives to plastic, influencing new procurement and education policy across the region.

","When Tonga launched the Pacific Peer Learning Platform, it didn’t start with experts — it started with neighbours. From the Solomon Islands came stories of villages returning to banana leaf wraps. In New Caledonia, youth redesigned snack spaces so people sat and shared instead of grabbing plastic takeaway. These community-led solutions, shared through the platform, reshaped Tonga’s approach. Instead of bans, they ran storytelling festivals and village challenges. Behaviour shifted — and the plastics disappeared.

Local schools integrated the platform as part of civic education. Policy design in fisheries, tourism, and land use increasingly referenced audio-based consultations with elders.

","On the island of Taha’a, Hina, a 17-year-old student, visited her uncle to ask how the tides had changed since his youth. She recorded his story — complete with pauses, chants, and a warning told in metaphor. That recording became a case study in the Territorial Assembly’s coastal adaptation workshop. For the first time, elders were not ""informants"" but designers of law.
