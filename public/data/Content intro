BLOCK 1 TITLE  A Call for Pacific Resilience

BLOCK 1 TITLE TEXT This "game" is a call to action for the creation of a new paradigm: a Resilient Pacific reflecting Pacific culture, Pacific knowledge, and Pacific connection to land that must be cared for to perpetuate customs and ways of life.

The 2050 Strategy features 10 commitments that Pacific Leaders have made to strengthen collective action and deepen regionalism. 
This piece was created to link stories to frameworks—to share and simplify by gamifying the great vision that our leaders have for our region.



The Strategy brings together seven interconnected thematic areas: 
Political Leadership and Regionalism, People-Centered Development, Peace and Security, Resource and Economic Development, Climate Change and Disasters, Ocean and Environment, and Technology and Connectivity. 

This work analyzed each thematic area and its outcomes, anchoring strategy indicators (like % of women in parliament) in fictional stories that bridge policy complexity with lived reality. 
Each game choice connects to specific strategy outcomes and indicators, demonstrating how decisions create ripple effects toward the 2050 goals.
