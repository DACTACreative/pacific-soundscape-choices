BLOCK 1 TITLE  A Call for Pacific Resilience

BLOCK 1 TITLE TEXT This "game" is a call to action for the creation of a new paradigm: a Resilient Pacific reflecting Pacific culture, Pacific knowledge, and Pacific connection to land that must be cared for to perpetuate customs and ways of life.

The 2050 Strategy features 10 commitments that Pacific Leaders have made to strengthen collective action and deepen regionalism. 
This piece was created to link stories to frameworksâ€”to share and simplify by gamifying the great vision that our leaders have for our region.


The Strategy brings together seven interconnected thematic areas: 

Political Leadership and Regionalism, 
People-Centered Development, 
Peace and Security, Resource and 
Economic Development, 
Climate Change and Disasters, 
Ocean and Environment, and 
Technology and Connectivity. 

The work here involved analyzing each thematic area and its linked outcomes, then anchoring strategy indicators (like % of women in parliament) 
in fictionnal "real" stories that bridge the gap between policy complexity and lived reality. 
Each game choice connects to specific strategy outcomes and indicators, showing how decisions can create ripple effects toward the 2050 goals.
