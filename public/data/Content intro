BLOCK 1 TITLE  A Call for Pacific Resilience

BLOCK 1 TITLE TEXT Lets create a new paradigm: a Resilient Pacific reflecting Pacific culture, Pacific knowledge & Customs, A pacific that Protect our connection to the land & perpertuate our way of life. 

The 2050 Strategy features 10 commitments that Pacific Leaders have made to strengthen collective action and deepen regionalism. 
This piece was created to link stories to frameworks—to share and simplify by gamifying the great vision that our leaders have for our region.

Quantitative indicators show what changed, but qualitative stories show why it matters.
This experience blends indicators with stories because Pacific policy works best when it speaks our language.
Because In small island contexts, a 2% GDP shift affects every family and a 10cm sea level rise reshapes entire communities. 

The Strategy brings together seven interconnected thematic areas: 
Political Leadership and Regionalism, People-Centered Development, Peace and Security, Resource and Economic Development, Climate Change and Disasters, Ocean and Environment, and Technology and Connectivity. 
This work analyzed each thematic area and its outcomes, anchoring strategy indicators (like % of women in parliament) in fictional stories that bridge policy complexity with lived reality. 
Each game choice connects to a specific strategy outcomes and indicators, demonstrating how decisions create ripple effects toward the 2050 goals.

Each decision will impact the type of Pacific you build. Will your choices lean toward people development while leaving economic power behind? 
Or will you manage to make decisions that reflect all main thematics while meeting their levels of ambition?
Each answer directly impacts one thematic but can also contribute to others—that's the magic we often miss when measuring impact: TIME.
After each answer, you'll be projected directly into the grounded reality of your decision by hearing the story and impact it has on someone's life.
And the game begins—Will you stay on track with the Blue Pacific thematics, or will you prioritize one decision above another? Will you be able to identify the outcomes they support and their potential ripple effects on others?



Your Journey to 2050

Throughout this experience, you'll hear Fiji's ocean tides from October 10, 2024. 
Because as people of the Pacific, sea level rise is in the background of our lives. 
It's music that plays on without us having much control over the ending.

And Whils we build a resilient future, representing less than 2% of global emissions across 20% of Earth's surface means our destiny depends on the world's choices.

At the end, the game will randomly achoose one of three climate scenarios:
- **1.5°C warming** (SSP1-1.9: Paris Agreement target, rapid decarbonization))
- **3°C warming** (SSP2-4.5: Paris Agreement target, rapid decarbonization))
- **5°C warming** (SSP5-8.5:high emissions pathway, limited climate action)


When you reach 2050, you'll discover which scenario the world chose while you were shaping Pacific resilience. The same October tides will sound very different 25 years later.

Enjoy the game—see you in the future.















Real ocean tide data from Fiji (October 10, 2024) forms this experience's foundation.

Every high tide = rising water. Every low = retreat six hours later.

This isn't ambient sound — it's live environmental data converted to audio.

For Pacific communities, the ocean isn't background noise — it's the constant connecting 15 nations across 30 million km² of sea.

Data becomes visceral. Policy becomes personal. The sound of the ocean grounds every decision you'll make.


To carry you throught this experience, you be hearing the sound of the ocean, Fiji Tide on the 10 of October 2024. 
Because as peopl eof the pacific, sea rise level is in the background of out lifes. 
It's a Music that go on wihtout us having much control on the ending. 

By represnting only 2% or glabel emission, global warming is an uncertintry, and shilst we build ressilent fuur for ourself
We might end up someone beetwing the 3 scenraio predicted by NASA  - SP01 = 1.5% global wamring ( check names and source) 
sp002 = 2.5% sea rise or sp03 = 5% sea rise 

ONce the game finsihed and the tiime passed - you will be 2050 and will discover what Scneario the word played you you were too. 
and you will hear the difference in sounds represntaing the same time 25 yo - 

Enjoy the game adn seee you in 2050.
