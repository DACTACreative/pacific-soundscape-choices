## üåä About

Blue Paradigm is an interactive narrative game that translates the dense framework of the **2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent** into an engaging, human-centered experience. As a Pacific leader, players make strategic decisions across seven interconnected thematic areas, with each choice affecting a complex scoring system designed to reflect real-world policy trade-offs.

The game challenges players to achieve a "balanced result" by meeting the "Level of Ambition" for all themes‚Äîa success metric visualized through dynamic spider charts and thematic review cards. This quantitative feedback is paired with qualitative stories and innovative data sonification of Fijian ocean tides, grounding abstract policy in the lived, sensory reality of the Pacific.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Interactive Policy Simulation**: Navigate complex climate and development decisions across 7 thematic areas
- **Data Sonification**: Experience sea-level rise through generative soundscapes based on real Suva, Fiji tide data
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Spider charts and interactive cards provide immediate feedback on policy choices
- **Balanced Gameplay**: Carefully calibrated scoring system with ~0.49% success rate (10 winning combinations out of 2,048 possible)
- **Educational Impact**: Familiarizes players with official Pacific climate strategy language and ambitions

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Built With
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.x
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn-ui components
- **Data Processing**: Custom algorithms for policy scoring and visualization
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for tide sonification

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Scoring System
The game features a meticulously balanced point system across seven themes:
- Political Leadership and Regionalism
- People Centered Development  
- Climate Change and Disasters
- Peace and Security
- Resource and Economic Development
- Ocean and Environment
- Technology and Connectivity

Players must achieve 4.5+ points in ALL themes simultaneously to win‚Äîrepresenting the real-world challenge of balanced, sustainable development.

### Data Foundation
- **Strategic Analysis**: Based on granular analysis of the 2050 Strategy Implementation Plan
- **Real-World Grounding**: Cross-referenced with official indicators, outcomes, and "Levels of Ambition"
- **Audio Design**: Tide sonification using actual Suva Harbor data (October 10-11, 2024)
